# Daymet weather variables include daily minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation,
# vapor pressure, shortwave radiation, snow water equivalent, and day length produced on
# a 1 km x 1 km gridded surface over continental North America and Hawaii from 1980 and
# over Puerto Rico from 1950 through the end of the most recent full calendar year.

# Daymet data documentation: https://daac.ornl.gov/DAYMET/guides/Daymet_Daily_V4.html

# Note: The Daymet calendar is based on a standard calendar year. All Daymet years, including
# leap years, have 1â€“365 days. For leap years, the Daymet data include leap day (February 29)
# and December 31 is discarded from leap years to maintain a 365-day year.

# Loading necessary packages
library(daymetr)
# NOTE - I'M USING THE DAYMETR PACKAGE, SPECIFICALLY DEVELOPED TO DOWNLOAD DAYMET DATA INTO R.
# THIS RUNS THE RISK OF THE PACKAGE BECOMING OUTDATED THOUGH, MAYBE WE WANT TO SCRAPE DATA OFF DAYMET A DIFFERENT WAY.
# WE WILL ALSO NEED TO MANUALLY CONVERT EVENT DATES INTO SEQUENTIAL YEAR DAYS (OR VICE-VERSA)
